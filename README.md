# STOP-iOS: Sentient Tracking of Parkinson's
STOP is the application for regular informing Parkinson's Disease patients on their medication adherence

## Features

### Ball game
The built-in game that asks a user to keep the ball in the center of the circles as still as possible. The game tracks and records accelerometer, linear accelerometer, gyroscope and rotation data that is used for the esimation of PD severity level of a user. The size of the ball and circles, ball speed and game time are customizable in the application settings.

### Medication journal
Journal for recording medication sessions time to follow the medication adherece. Timestams recording is available either with intelligence voice recognition or with manual input.

### Notifications
The application triggers notifications four times per day to remind user to play a game and record last medication sessions and once per day between 10:00 and 11:00 to ask user to report the severity level of PD for the previous day.

### Feedback
The feedback for the application can be sent straight from the application. Both manual input and voice recognition are supported.
