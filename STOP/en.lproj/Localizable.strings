The game success is evaluated using 0 (min) - 100 (max) scale. In addition the user is asked to record the medication taking time to the journal. The research will use the collected information for searching correlation between motor functionalities and medication effectiveness.\n\nSTOP application sends notifications about the game and medication recording four times per day.
